# Enigma-Machine
This project simulates the operation of the famous WWII Enigma Machine, a cipher device used by the Germans to encrypt messages. The program takes a text input and encrypts or decrypts it using a configuration of rotors, a plugboard, and a reflector, similar to the original machine.
Key Features:
- Rotors: Three configurable rotors (I, II, III) that rotate with each keystroke to scramble the letters.
-Reflector: Reflector B is used to reverse the signal, ensuring encryption is a two-way process.
- Ring Settings & Positions: Simulated through adjustable rotor settings.
- Plugboard: Customizable letter pairs that swap positions before and after rotor encryption.
- Caesar Shift: Rotors apply a Caesar cipher-like shift to each letter before reflection.
The user inputs text, and the program outputs the encoded or decoded message, mimicking how the real Enigma Machine functioned.
